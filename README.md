## Two main differences:
- Instead of using Antropic it uses Open Router and allows to set API Key from the Client
- It also adds support to download the current project state as a zip file


## A Few more features are planned:
- different models from open router selection and search, some of them free
- default key with 0 budget that allows to use only free open router model
